American sycamore+_+ +_+These trees produce unusual, spiny seed balls that remain on the tree throughout the winter. When sycamore trees reach maturity, their bark becomes distinctively smooth and white. Many people believe this sycamore is the oldest tree on the University of Illinois campus.+_+Platanus occidentalis+_+40.105195,-88.227870+_+leaf
London planetree+_+ +_+This species occurred as a spontaneous hybrid between the Oriental sycamore and American sycamore. This tree is ideal for urban settings because of its shallow root system, ability to thrive in compact soils, and it can handle high levels of pollutants. +_+Platanus x. acerifolia+_+40.105499,-88.226624+_+leaf
White oak+_+ +_+The white oak is the official state tree of Illinois. It can be found in every county in the state. The white oak is named for the smooth, white patches left behind when bark is removed by the harmless fungi Aleurodiscus oakesii.+_+Quercus alba+_+40.105905,-88.226852+_+leaf
Shagbark hickory+_+ +_+The peeling, shaggy bark of this hickory is unique and makes this species easily identifiable. Its wood is desirable for its strong and pleasant aroma and is often used to smoke meats and other foods. This tree also produces an edible nut, which Native Americans collected and stored in huge quantities to use as a staple of their diet.+_+Carya ovata+_+40.106589,-88.226380+_+leaf
Kentucky coffeetree+_+ +_+Years ago, a much larger Kentucky coffeetree stood in its place—until it was struck by lightning! Because of the damage, it began to die. Before the tree was removed, branch cuttings were collected from it and used to propagate new seedlings that would be genetically identical. The tree you are looking at is a genetic clone of the original specimen.+_+Gymnocladus dioicus+_+40.106811,-88.226423+_+leaf
Saucer magnolia+_+ +_+This magnolia has large, furry buds that open in early spring to display beautiful blooms in white and pink that can grow up to ten inches across.

Eastern redbud+_+ +_+The eastern redbud is a small tree in the pea family recognized by the bright pinkish-purple flowers it produces each spring. The individual flowers are quite small, but they grow in eye-catching bunches along the branches which highlights the architecture of these trees. The leaves of the redbud are heart-shaped.+_+Cercis canadensis+_+40.107900,-88.226490+_+leaf
Ginkgo+_+ +_+Ginkgo biloba is the last remaining species in the genus Gingkophyta, which appeared in the fossil record over 270 million years ago. For many years, the gingko tree was thought to be extinct too. However, a single remaining tree was discovered at a Buddhist monastery from which the entire species was revived.+_+Gingko biloba+_+40.108522,-88.226612+_+leaf
Baldcypress+_+ +_+Although the baldcypress has needle-like leaves and seed-bearing cones, it is not an evergreen like most other conifers. In the fall, the needles turn orange or red and drop to the ground. This tree is one of the longest living organisms—the oldest known specimen is currently over 1,620 years old.+_+Taxodium distichum+_+40.109448,-88.226800+_+leaf
Bur oak+_+ +_+The bur oak is named for the unusual, fringed overcup that covers the acorns. See if you can find one on the ground! The deeply ridged bark is very thick, which helps to protect this tree from prairie fires in the native Illinois savanna ecosystem.+_+Quercus macrocarpa+_+40.110017,-88.225840+_+leaf
Sugar maple+_+ +_+In the fall, the sugar maple displays beautiful deep red and orange leaves. Sugar maple grows quickly and are one of the most common species in Midwestern deciduous forests.

River birch+_+ +_+These young river birch have several layers of papery, peeling bark. As they mature, the papery bark will be replaced by more solid, white scales. River birch thrives in the wet and nutrient-rich soil along rivers. River birch is a ‘pioneer’ species, meaning it tends to be one of the first species to establish in an area, usually after flooding events.+_+Betula nigra+_+40.111373,-88.226840+_+leaf
Flowering crabapple+_+ +_+The Japanese flowering crabapple grows as a round-headed tree with narrow leaves and beautiful arching branches.

American beech+_+ +_+The American beech has distinctly smooth, silvery bark. Due to the hardness and density of the bark, these trees were generally left uncut until the invention of power tools in the 20th century. These strong trees are shade-tolerant and are often found in very old forests in the latest stages of succession.+_+Fagus grandifolia+_+40.110173,-88.228136+_+leaf
